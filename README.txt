SenatorVotes

Group Members: Joe Adkisson, Michael Stoneman, Jamie Emery

Features Implemented:
- Look up senators and see their voting records and biographical info
- Look up bills and see senators who voted for them
- Sort senators by states
- Display rudimentary information about party voting percentages on bills
- Sort bills chronologically
- Sort senators by congresses(i.e. current congress is the 114th congress)

- Additionally, we added committee objects, which are bilaterally linked to
  both their super-/sub-committees (if applicable) and the senators in them.
  The database's structure made it easy to add, so we did.
